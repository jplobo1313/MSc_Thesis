# G-Tric: enhancing triclustering evaluation using three-way synthetic datasets with ground truth: Master Thesis's Repository
Code and results produced during my master's thesis.

Contents:
- [Datasets](https://github.com/jplobo1313/MSc_Thesis/tree/main/Benchmark_Datasets) folder contains the datasets using to perform the becnhmark.
- [Results](https://github.com/jplobo1313/MSc_Thesis/tree/main/Results) folder contain csv files for each algorithm's grid search run, as well as, a resume csv file with the best run of each one.
- [Metrics](https://github.com/jplobo1313/MSc_Thesis/tree/main/Evaluation_Metrics) folder provides the implementation of several evaluation functions used during the project, such as, 3D *MSR*, *Recoverability*, *Intra-Temporal Homogeneity*, *Inter-Temporal Homogeneity*, and the proposed 3D version of *Clustering Error*.

G-Tric's code and application are available [here](https://github.com/jplobo1313/G-Tric).
